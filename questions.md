# Some Questions for Thought

Over the past year or so Microservices Architecture has emerged as a widely discussed style for building distributed web/internet systems.  Proponents argue that this variant of service-oriented architecture (SOA) is well-suited to addressing the challenges of cloud computing, scalability, and complexity, among others.  It is often paired with DevOps (i.e., developer operations, where the development team is also responsible for deployment and management of the system).  SOA itself was criticized as a buzzword that rebranded existing patterns of distributed computing.  It is possible that microservices is a similar rebranding.

This workshop will explore various facets of microservices architecture.  Based on what we learn, we'll create a poster at the end of the day that summarizes our findings to share with the SATURN community during the conference Welcome Reception. Some questions and topics we will consider during the workshop include the following.  Some questions and topics we will consider during the workshop include the following.

## Clarifying the ideas

- Definition of a Style -- What is Microservices and how is it different from regular SOA?  What quality attributes is the style meant to promote?  What quality attributes are inhibited?  What elements, relationships, and constraints make up the style?  What architectural principles, patterns, practices might define the microservices style?
- Organizational Influence -- How might organizational communication structures or development cultures influence Microservices?  Likewise, how might adopting a Microservices architecture change your organization?
- Problem Framing -- What problem does microservices solve? What kinds of problems is a microservices architecture better or worse at solving?  In what contexts do microservices make sense (or not make sense)?

## Concerns
- Big Balls of Mud -- What’s to prevent a system adopting microservices from turning into just another Big Ball of Mud?
- Monolith Straw man -- Nearly all microservices proponents pick on an unmaintainable, abominable "monolithic application".  Does this monolith application boogeyman actually exist?  What aspects of this straw man deserve our attention and which are intentional falsehoods set up for the sake of argument?
- Dependency management -- While services themselves might be independently deployable, individual services often rely on others. Add to this the significant groundwork required for automated deployment and maintenance.  What are the challenges and what strategies exist for managing dependencies among services?  What gaps remain?

## Evaluation
- Potential Future Benefits (or Problems) -- Microservices seems to have already enabled new ways of thinking about deployment and testing.  What other potential software development innovations might be awaiting us that were not possible or cost prohibitive using other architecture approaches?  Or... might larger problems be looming on the horizon?
- Ignorance and Concerns -- What don’t we know about the microservices approach?  What should we as a community be worried about or trying to figure out about microservices that we don’t know today?
- Popularity -- Microservices seemed to have gained a lot of attention recently.  Why now?  Is it more popular in some technology circles than others?  What about microservices is so appealing?  Why aren’t these attributes addressed in other styles?
